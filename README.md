# ARAS Active Learning Tools

This repository provides some supporting tools to the [ARAS SKMulti Model Generator](https://github.com/ronsm/ARAS-SKMulti-Model-Generator) and [HAR Query Committee](https://github.com/ronsm/HAR-Query-Committee/) software.

This software forms part of a system to enable simulation of a real smart home with multiple HAR classifiers, to enable experiments in active learning.

## Install / Requirements

To install, run these commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/ronsm/ARAS-Active-Learning-Tools.git
cd /directory/where/you/cloned/to
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data

You must supply the training, validation, and annotated data. The training and validation files (```train.csv``` and ```validation.csv```) are sourced from [ARAS SKMulti Model Generator](https://github.com/ronsm/ARAS-SKMulti-Model-Generator), while the annotations file (```annotations.csv```) file is generated by [HAR Query Committee](https://github.com/ronsm/HAR-Query-Committee/).

These files should be provided as follows:

```
├── data
│   ├── annotations.csv
│   ├── train.csv
│   └── validation.csv
└── ...
```

### Models

You must provide the trained models from [ARAS SKMulti Model Generator](https://github.com/ronsm/ARAS-SKMulti-Model-Generator). You should (rename and) place under the ```models/train``` __and__ ```models/with_annotations``` (three models for each type of training) folders the ```.p``` files. The prediction class is agnostic to the nature of many models in Scikit-Multiflow, and so you should rename the three models to be generic, as shown:

```
├── models
│   ├── train
│   │   ├── Model1.p    # i.e. renamed from 'HoeffdingTree.p', etc.
│   │   ├── Model2.p
│   │   └── Model3.p
│   ├── with_annotations
│   │   ├── Model1.p    # i.e. renamed from 'HoeffdingTree.p', etc.
│   │   ├── Model2.p
│   │   └── Model3.p
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## Usage

The script ```ARAS_active_learning_tools.py``` provides two functions:
* Merging annotated data into the training set, to be used for re-training
* Validating trained models (with and without annotations included) against the validation set

```
python3 ARAS_active_learning_tools.py merge/validate
```
